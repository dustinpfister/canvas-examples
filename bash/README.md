# canvas-examples bash folder

For my canvas-examples repo I want to make some bash scripts that will help me automate some work. Such as creating a package for a canvas example.

## build-pkg.sh

The main build-pkg.sh script will run over all canvas examples and create a package for that folder by calling a local build-pkg script if it finds one.
