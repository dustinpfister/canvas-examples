# todo list for canvas-examples bash folder

## bash
* (done) I will want to start a main build-pkg script based off of what I worked out in canvas-example-hyper-casual-space-shooter
* a 'create-js-path' script for creating a /js/canvas-examples/\[folderName\]/\[ver\] /pkg.js public folder for a site, this script will just need to copy over pkg.js files created with build-pkg.sh
* a 'embed-posts' script that will inject html for every markdown file in a posts folder that is a canvas example post
