# todo list for canvas-examples bash folder

# (done - but check local todo.md) build-pkg
* (done) I will want to start a main 'build-pkg' script based off of what I worked out in canvas-example-hyper-casual-space-shooter

# create-js-path
* a 'create-js-path' script for creating a /js/canvas-examples/\[folderName\]/\[ver\] /pkg.js public folder for a site, this script will just need to copy over pkg.js files created with build-pkg.sh

# embed-posts
* a 'embed-posts' script that will inject html for every markdown file in a posts folder that is a canvas example post

# create-aliases
* a 'create-aliases' script that will check for aliases in ~/.bashrc and append them to the file if they are not there
* '$ canvas-build', and '$ cb' for /bash/build-pkg/index.sh
