## main.js
<!-- *************************************** -->
* get touch support working
* have building state display a building menu
* the building menu can be used to delete a building
* use localStorage to save and load state
* do something with window.devicePixelRatio


### map.js
<!-- *************************************** -->
* status bar displays current tick progress
* make it so building a building debits money
* have a building cell index
* total map worth property
* highestCellWorth property
* cell worth / highestCellWorth used to set type property
* do something with the worth value of cells.

## pm.js
<!-- *************************************** -->
* get touch support working


## utils.js
<!-- *************************************** -->



## draw.js
<!-- *************************************** -->

* sprite sheets and draw image calls
