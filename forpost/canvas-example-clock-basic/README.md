# canvas-example-clock-basic

This canvas example is of a basic clock using a canvas element and a little javaScript. For my basic clock example I made a clock that is a weird combination of a digital clock and an analog clock. To read more on this canvas example be sure to check out my [blog post on this basic canvas clock](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2019/12/13/canvas-example-clock-basic/), as there should be a corresponding blog post on all of these examples in the for post folder.

## /lib folder

The lib folder contains the clock.js file that can be used to create a clock object, and a draw.js file that is used to redner the state of that object to a canvas element.

## main.js, and index.html

The main.js file is where I am creating an injecting the canvas element into the html, and it is also where I am creating a clock state object in an app loop also.
