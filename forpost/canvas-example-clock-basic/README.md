# canvas-example-clock-basic

This canvas example is of a basic clock using a canvas element and a little javaScript. For my basic clock example I made a clock that is a weird combination of a digital clock and an analog clock. To read more on this canvas example be sure to check out my [blog post on this basic canvas clock](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2019/12/13/canvas-example-clock-basic/), as there should be a corresponding blog post on all of these examples in the for post folder.
