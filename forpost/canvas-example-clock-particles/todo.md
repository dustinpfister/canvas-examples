## canvas-example-clock-particles

* particles change color based on the time of year

## 0.0.0 - the basic idea
* (done) particles increase in speed as we progress threw the current week
* (done) distance transparency effect for particles
* (done) faceRadius value for clock object
* (done) use faceRadius in clock.js
* (done) use faceRadius in draw.js
* (done) face centered and scaled
* (done) have a particles pool for the clock object
* (done) more particles become active as the day progress to noon and less as the day progress to midnight
* display v0.0.0 in the canvas
* make a pkg-0-0-0.html
