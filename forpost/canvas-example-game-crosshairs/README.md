# canvas-example-game-crosshairs

This canvas example is the first example that I have started pouring a fair amount of time and effort into. Typically with many of these canvas examples I just quickly throw together a basic idea for something together in a few hours, or at most a day or two before moving on to the next idea. I of course wanted to break that pattern at some point and thus far I have done so with this project.

## A resent version of cross hairs can be played at my website

Like many of these canvas examples I have wrote a single [blog post on this cross hairs game example](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2020/07/29/canvas-example-game-crosshairs/) that follows a pattern when it comes to file names of my markdown files for blog posts. A late version of the game should often be embedded in the post along with detailed writing on the source code of that version.

The latest version can of course be found here, but it may not be stable. Or at least it might not be a good idea to invest a great deal of time playing it at this point. This project is still very much in movement, and game state breaking changes can still happen.
