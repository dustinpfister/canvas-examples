# canvas-example-pop-the-lock

This is what started out as a simple clone of the Game _pop the lock_ for android, and turned into a bit of a major project that is still a bit of a work in progress, although I am pretty sure I have many of the basic features solid sense it is a pretty simple game in terms of the mechanics.

## How to Play

There are a number of game modes, but all of them are just slighlty different vareations of the same basic concept. There is a small circle that moves along the circumfrence of a larger circle. once the smaller circle is over a target area, the player just clicks the mouse, or touches the screen on touch devices. Each game mode is just changing up the rules a little when it comes to what happens if the player clicks to soon, or what happens when the player is to late and misses the target. There is also what to do when a target is in fact hit, for example when that happens should the speed of the smaller circle go up, or say the same?
