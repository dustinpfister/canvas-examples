# canvas-example-mr-sun

This is a canvas example of a game where the player can control the position of a Sun relative to sections of a world that is positioned around the Sun. There is more than one canvas-example based off of this source code, but this is the main canvas example for all of them, as such the focus here is on the core of the applaction itself, and not so much with plug-ins as with the others.

When I make a new fork of Mr Sun I will often copy a version of this project, or one of the other forks. Each fork does have its own copy of the core source code here, and often I make at least a few changes that may or may not make it to this example.

It may be true that the focus is on the state of the core of a applaction rather than a finished game here. However I am also creating a small collection of base plug-ins that will often show up in other canvas examples. I do need to make at least a few in order to just demo core features after all.
