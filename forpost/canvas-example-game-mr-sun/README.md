# canvas-example-mr-sun

This is a canvas example of a game where the player can control the position of a Sun relative to sections of a world that is positioned around the Sun. There is more than one canvas-example based off of this source code, but this is the main canvas example for all of them. So in this example the focus here is on the core of the application itself, and not so much with plug-ins that have to do with taking this general idea to a final destination.

When I make a new fork of Mr Sun I will often copy a version of this project, or one of the other forks. Each fork does have its own copy of the core source code here, and often I make at least a few changes that may or may not make it to this example. Tis is because in this canvas-examples repo I want each example to be an independent project with all the source code, and other assets in the folder.

It may be true that the focus is on the state of the core of a application rather than a finished game here. However I am also creating a small collection of core plug-ins for game.js, and now also state-machine.js that will often show up in other canvas examples that are forks of this example.
