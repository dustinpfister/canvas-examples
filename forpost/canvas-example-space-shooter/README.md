# canvas-example-space-shooter

This is the source code for my [space shooter canvas example that I wrote a post on](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2019/08/21/canvas-example-space-shooter/) where I write about the source code for this in detail. This is just one of my many other other [canvas examples](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2020/03/23/canvas-example/) that I have made thus far.

In this canvas example that general idea was to just have a very simple game where I move a ship around and blast enemy ships. There was not much more that I wanted to do beyond that with this example at least. If I do put more time into this example it will likely be to just improve the readability and structure of the source code rather than going nuts with features.
