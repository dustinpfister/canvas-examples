# canvas-examples

This is all the source code for my collection of [posts on canvas examples](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2020/03/23/canvas-example/) on my website here at github pages. For each canvas example in the forPost folder there should be a corresponding blog post in which I write about a given canvas example in detail.

Each folder is its own independent project folder, and most if not all should work by way of the file protocol in a web browser. In other words you can just open the main index.html of a folder, no need to serve them locally.

## The forPost, and prototype Folders

In the forpost folder each example folder there should correspond with a blog post on my website here ah github pages in which I write about the example in detail. In addition there is a prototypes folder that contains canvas examples in the works that I may or may not complete and write about at a future date. Just becuase an example is in the for post folder that does not mean that it is a done deal, some of these I am continuing to support, others I might get around to at some point but I would not hold my breath.

## Note Worthy examples thus far

Many of these canvas examples are in various states of completion and or quality. If an idea for something is simple enough then maybe it is done, but in any case the bulk of these examples thus far do deserve some more attention at least I think so anyway. So I think that it is worth mentioning which examples have been receiving the most time and effort from me.

### - [Hyper Casual Space shooter](forpost/canvas-example-hyper-casual-space-shooter)

This example aims to be just a simple space shooter where I just fly around and blow up blocks. Beyond that any and all additional features that I add will just have to do with things like weapons, upgrades, navigation, properties of the blocks, and maybe just a few simple animations. I aim to keep the focus on the game logic itself rather than graphics and flashy features that do not always add to the value of a game.

### - [Cross hairs](forpost/canvas-example-game-crosshairs)

This is the first example that I have broken a certain pattern where I am quickly getting an example togetaher in a few hours, or a day or so, and then move on to the next thing. This is the first canvas example in the whole collection that I have put a fair amount of time into, and thus should be on this list.

### - [Mr Sun](forpost/canvas-example-game-mr-sun)

This is another example that I have put a lot of time into thus far, so I should have it listed here for the reason alone. However as of this writing there is still not much to write about with this one, at least in terms of the game play at least. The code is another matter of course, the best feature thus far with this one would be the plug in system thus far. I intend to make several forks off of the source code of this once I get this main example solid.
