# canvas-examples

This is all the source code for my collection of [posts on canvas examples](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2020/03/23/canvas-example/) for each canvas example in the forPost folder there should be a corresponding blog post in which I write about a given canvas example in detail. 

## The forPost, and prototype Folders

In the forpost folder each example there should correspond with a blog post on my website here ah github pages in which I write about the example in detail. In addition there is a prototypes folder that contains canvas examples in the works that I may or may not complete and write about at a future date.

## Note Worthy examples thus far

Many of these canvas examples are in various states of completion and or quality. If an idea for something is simple enough then maybe it is done, but in any case the bulk of these examples thus far do deserve some more attention. So I think that it is worth mentioning which examples have been getting more attestation then others hear.

### - [Hyper Casual Space shooter](forpost/canvas-example-hyper-casual-space-shooter)

This example aims to be just a simple space shooter. I aim to keep the focus on the game logic itself rather than graphics and flashy features that do not always add to the value of a game.

### - [Cross hairs](forpost/canvas-example-game-crosshairs)

This is the first example that I have broken a certain pattern with, as of this writing I have been coming back to it now and then for over a month thus far.

### - [Mr Sun](forpost/canvas-example-game-mr-sun)

This is another example that I have put a lot of time into thus far. It still needs a little more work though.
