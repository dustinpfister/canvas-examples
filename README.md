# canvas-examples

This is all the source code for my collection of [posts on canvas examples](https://dustinpfister.github.io/2020/03/23/canvas-example/) for each canvas example in the forPost folder there should be a corresponding blog post in which I write about each canvas example in detail. 

## The forPost, and prototype Folders

In the forpost folder each example there should correspond with a blog post on my website here ah github pages in which I write about the example in detail. In addition there is a prototypes folder that contains canvas examples in the works that I may or may not complete and write about at a future date.
