# canvas-example-mr-sun-temp

This is a canvas example of a game where the player can control the position of a Sun relative to sections of a world that is positioned around the Sun. In this canvas example I am started with the source code for canvas-example-mr-sun v0.1.0 to create a more complex example that adds a few new features, and plugins. Changes made here, may end up being added to the core example or this might just end up being its own thing.
