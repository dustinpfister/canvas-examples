# canvas-example-mr-sun

## 0.0.0 - Basic idea working
* (done) start with a basic state machine with event support
* (done) have a circle 'sun' display object in the center of the canvas
* have a number of 'section' display objects around the edge of an outer circle around the 'sun'
* the 'sun' object can be moved from the center to any point inside the outer circle
* each 'section' object has a percent value that is effected by the distance between the 'section' and the 'sun'
* for now just have the percent value of a 'section' object effect the color of the section, and display the percent value for it.
* make a pkg_0_0_0.html
