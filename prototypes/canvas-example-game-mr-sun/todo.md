# canvas-example-mr-sun

## 0.0.0 - Basic idea working
* (done) start with a basic state machine with event support
* (done) have a circle 'sun' display object in the center of the canvas
* (done) have a number of 'section' display objects around the edge of an outer circle around the 'sun'
* (done) the 'sun' object can be moved 
* (done) each 'section' object has a percent value that is effected by the distance between the 'section' and the 'sun'
* (done) for now just have the percent value of a 'section' object effect the color of the section, and display the percent value for it.
* (done) create a game.js file and pull all methods that have to do with creating, and updating a game objet thus far into it.
* (done) create a draw.js module for this example
* (done) start a utils.js module
* (done) make it so the sun can not leave inner radius
* display version number in canvas
* make a pkg_0_0_0.html
