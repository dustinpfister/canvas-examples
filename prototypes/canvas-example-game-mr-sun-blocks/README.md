# canvas-example-mr-sun-blocks

This is another fork of the Mr Sun source code this time starting with Mr Sun 0.5.0. This time I am making new plugins for game.js, as well as with the new state machine system to create a collections of blocks that can be in a grid for each game world section object. The general idea is that there are types for rock, water, and so forth.
