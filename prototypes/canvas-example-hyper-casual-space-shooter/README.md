# canvas-example-hyper-casual-space-shooter

I just wanted to make a simple space shooter for this canvas example. After working on a few examples where I end up writing thousands of lines of code, yet still feel as though the examples is lacking, I now want to start making examples that fit the moto "less code more game".

The idea I have for this one is to just fly around and blast stuff, thats it.
